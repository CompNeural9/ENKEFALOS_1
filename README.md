# Enkefalos
Here you will find the code, as well as the input and output data, for our Enkefalos computational tool. Data was derived from a study done by the Pavlidis Lab at the University of British Columbia. You can find the description of the data and how it was derived [here](https://github.com/PavlidisLab/transcriptomic_correlates).
# Notebook
